## Routes on paper

State will live in most components because of animations needing state to run.

## Today's accomplishments or lack of
* read and researched how to get animations to work in various ways with now luck, links to articles and videos watched below:
* https://reactjs.org/docs/animation.html
* https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-animations
* https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_wFkcg7gTI
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZRyIOrWfHU
* Trying to use a different animation plugin since react transition group is now no longer updating.
* FINALLY got it working by going into a different project that I had working animations on and compared the package.json files and saw minor version differences, after changing those the animations started working without a problem.
